# Final project for the course CS50 PYTHON - Harvard (2023)

Harvard's CS50 Python course can be found [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/)

This personal project consists of a simple web application that allows users to find cocktail recipes.
All the data comes from one API : [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/)

The app allows to :

- Find lists of cocktails based on a first letter
- Retrieve a cocktail's recipe when clicking one cocktail
- Get a random recipe
- Find cocktails based on one ingredient's name
- Find cocktails based on its name
